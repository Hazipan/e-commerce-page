## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

In this project I learned about what a lightbox is and how to use framer-motion! Framer motion is really easy to use and adds a great touch of proffesionalism to any project

### Continued development

From here, I'm going to start working on front-end project more on the side and spend the majority of my time learning back-end, starting with Node.js and Express.js, then moving into databases.
